# UFOs

## Overview of Project
Now that Dana has a webpage and a table that is working, we are looking to provide a more in=depth analysis of UFO sightings. For this to be accomplished we need to allow users of the webiste to filter with multipule criteria all at the same time. The criteria that needed to be added in addition to the date was city, state, country, and shape. All of this was created using JavaScript, in additon to HTML, Bootstrape and CSS. 

## Results
### The Home Page

Once you are on the home page, you will see the "UFO Sighting" tab at the top of the page. If you are looking to reset your filters, selecting this is one way to do that. 

### Filters!

If you are looking for specific information, you can use these filters to do so! You can enter things such as the date, cities, States, countries, and even shapes!

Once you enter a specifc filter, such as here with the date of 1/4/2010, you can see the results that have that date entered.

## Summary
One draw back of the additions to the website for Dana is that if you are looking for a specific event, you would need to know the exact information to find that one event. Or, you will have to put in the information that you know and scroll and seach until you find what you are looking for. I way that you could fix this would to have a list of available listings, such as you would see on a clothing shopping website, and check the things that you are looking for. Another option would be to have drop down filters instead of the check list. 

Overall, this website is a great option if you are looking for some information about UFOs. The user can easily find information that is important to them!
